 event messaging
custom events, subclasses of abstract events that reference the destination
{ couldn't as they expect general in arg and then I cast to appropriate. Just put enum inside :p }
settingsView sends events to viewRoot - run - updatesSettings - clockSettings - [back up] - clockview
 ModelRoot
to make the architecture symmetric, ie this will sort events for the model classes rather than Run
 ClockSettings
FrameW, frameH
 dispose on close
window.addwindowlistener ; setDefaultCloseOperation( nn.DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE )

	8 Oct
finish MOVE architecture
 make change listeners for the model's values
