### Unremarkable clock

An unremarkable clock, to be implemented in Java's Swing components, for integration into applications of the same.

Jar spawns a clock with an edit button. The edit dialog can edit the size/location of the frame at runtime. I think that fights with the gridbaglayout, though. There are two buttons for adjusting the font size, but that will come down eventually.

NOTE: pic is edited. Until I remove the gridbaglayout from clockview, it requires stretching the frame a lot.
